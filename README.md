## About this repo
While learning about data analysis in college, I had the opportunity to try out R and its several packages on datasets provided. I decided to take this chance to learn the new language and see how it compared to the other languages such as Python or Java. Besides learning the language, I also wanted to explore and deepen my knowledge in Machine Learning and develop my skills in data analysis. Thus, these files show some of the work I did with several ML algorithms. Given the chance, I hope to come back and learn more about R in the future but for now, I'll stick with Python.
