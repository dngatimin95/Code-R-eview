# Code-R-eview

While learning R in college, I had the oppurtunity to try out certain ML algorithms and play around with some dataset. As a TA for the class which teaches R, I delved deeper into the language and decided to learn more on my own and see how far I could go. This repo shows what I have learnt on my own and reveals that I actually prefer Python over R. Oops.
